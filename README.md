THE ODIN PROJECT – FOUNDATION COURSE

RECIPES PROJECT

A TOP project that requires users to create an index page containing links to three recipe pages. Each recipe page features a photo of the recipe plus texts for description, ingredients and method, and also a link back to the home page.

I'm not new to all this, so I've done some things not yet covered in TOP:

Used the flexbox layout method 
Responsive (layout, photos), so it works on phones – but without a hamburger menu, as that needs JS, which I know nothing about (yet) :-)
