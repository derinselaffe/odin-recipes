THE ODIN PROJECT â€“ FOUNDATION COURSE

RECIPES PROJECT

A TOP project that requires users to create an index page containing links to three recipe pages. Each recipe page features a photo of the recipe plus texts for description, ingredients and method, and also a link back to the home page.

I'm going to resist the urge to do all the things I'd normally do, such as make it responsive, style it and everything else.

As a result, it will be ugly, not work properly on smaller screens and ride roughshod over all sorts of best practices.

The sooner I've worked through all this stuff, the sooner I can get to the JS, which is what I'm really after :-)
