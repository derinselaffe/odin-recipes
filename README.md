THE ODIN PROJECT â€“ FOUNDATION COURSE

RECIPES PROJECT

A TOP project that requires users to create an index page containing links to three recipe pages. Each recipe page features a photo of the recipe plus texts for description, ingredients and method, and also a link back to the home page.

I'm not new to all this, so I've done some things not yet covered in TOP, including to make it responsive (work well on all screen sizes, including phones).
