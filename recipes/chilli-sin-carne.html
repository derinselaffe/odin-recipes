    <h1>Chilli sin carne</h1>

    <p>The best meat-free chilli recipe I've encountered. When I gave up eating meat a couple of years ago, I struggled to find a recipe for a vegetarian/vegan chilli that I not only enjoyed eating, but also wanted to make again. After trying a few disappointing ones using soya mince (= ultra-processed food), I found a lentil-based recipe in a German newspaper, which I adapted slightly.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><i>Serves 4 (or 2, if those people are me!)</i></p>
    <p><i>Difficulty: Easy</i></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 green pepper</li>
        <li>1 red pepper</li>
        <li>1 red chilli (but feel free to spice things with multiple habaneros or scotch bonnets etc, depending on what your tongue and digestive system can cope with)</li>
        <li>1 large onion (erm, or two smaller ones)</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 tin of kidney beans</li>
        <li>1 tin of sweetcorn</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil (or rapeseed oil, sunflower oil etc)</li>
        <li>250g red lentils</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons concentrated tomato puree</li>
        <li>2 tins of chopped tomatoes (or, of course, chop some 'real' tomatoes)</li>
        <li>1 litre of vegetable stock</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Pinch of cumin powder (or a good shaking, to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the peppers and chillies, remove the pepper cores and, unless you like your chillis very hot, remove their seeds.</li>
        <li>Peel the onion and garlic and chop into small pieces. (Alternatively, crush the garlic.)</li>
        <li>Rinse the kidney beans and sweetcorn under running water and allow to drain.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil and saut√© the onion for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the peppers, chillies, lentils, tomato puree, tinned tomatoes, kidney beans, sweetcorn, ground pepper, cumin powder and vegetable stock and stir well.</li>
        <li>Cover, bring to a boil and then simmer on low/medium heat for 30 minutes or so, until the lentils are soft.</li>
        <li>Serve with basmati rice and a dollop (or two, or three) of sour cream (vegetarian) or soya yoghurt (vegan).</li>
